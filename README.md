Problem Statement
Diabetes is a very common disease with many risk factors that can lead to getting diabetes.
Is it possible to predict whether a patient/individual is at a risk of early stage diabetes given the signs and symptoms.
Since we are using an already labelled dataset to build a predictive model our task will be a supervised machine learning problem
Therefore we will be using a supervised machine learning classification approach to solve our problem.
Based on the number of target class we have will will need to build a binary classifier type of ML model.
